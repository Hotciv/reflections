What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates a directory called .git.
	You need to do this in order to	start tracking it in Git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is an in between area, which you could make changes
	on what to commit before making a commit.
	It offers a way to rethink what you are about to commit; almost like
	a "cancel button".

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	Using "git diff" and "git diff --staged" you see what is different from
	what you are working and the stage area and what is different from what
	is in the stage area from the last commit

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	It is helpful whenever you want to make a change but is unsure of its
	outcomes or you want to experiment on something "dangerous".

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	Diagrams will literally show you what the branches look like...
	git log --graph --oneline master branch -> the command to see the 
	diagram

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
