When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Whenever you are doing some collaborative work or you could make use of the
    commit history.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you might not want to be dependent on having an Internet connection
    or you might not want to interfere with the remote and vice versa all the
    time you make an update.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is when you "clone a repository" within GitHub.
    Clone is when you get a copy of a repository, along with its commmit
    history.
    Branches is when you want to make commits that does not affect the main
    commit's history directly.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
